To get the maximum out of this source code, you should have 

* Node.js
* Visual Studio Code

installed on your computer.

If you need help, here's a FREE guide: https://triqui.gumroad.com/l/qousk

Then, simply copy a project folder on your computer,
then execute from Visual Studio Code terminal, or any other shell,
once inside the folder:

npm install

About 90MB of content will be installed.

Then:

npm run dev for a development build
npm run build for a distribution build (in dist folder)
npm run preview to preview the distribution build
